# FullStack_Template

_UPDATED_
Made some changes to the Fullstack Template to now include Mongoose and used async/await. Also updated the get method to include the schema so it can be turned into the model to help build the objects needed.

Created a schema.js to hold the mongoose schema that can be referenced when need to use specific databases.

This is a basic template to use to set up a server.js, main.js, style.css, index.ejs, .env, and .gitignore.

There are also a list of instructions appropriately named added along with the other files here.

Some basic knowledge of node.js and how to use npm (node package manager) install is required due to having to install express, cors, ejs, dotenv, mongoose. Also nodemon was also install here for the purpose of having the server update when changes are made instead of having to stop and restart the server repeatedly.

Mongoose is used for the database and the objects and other information will be the devs responsibility as to what type of db they are looking to build.

I hope this is helpful to anyone who needs a little help on how to start creating a simple app or database.

Also, I want to thank @Mayanwolfe for creating this template for everyone to use and create from.

HAPPY BUILDING!!
